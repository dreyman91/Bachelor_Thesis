Signal Strength Calculation Tests for SignalBasedModel

This test file focuses on testing the signal strength calculation functionality
of the SignalBasedModel class. The `_signal_strength` method implements an
inverse-square law with a softening term to compute signal strength based on
distance between agents.

We verify that:
1. The signal strength calculation follows the inverse-square law
2. The softening term prevents division by zero for very small distances
3. The method handles extreme distance values correctly
4. The transmit power parameter properly scales the signal strength
