    A communication model that simulates realistic wireless signal propagation.

    This model determines connectivity between agents based on:
    1. Physical distance between agents (using inverse-square law for signal attenuation)
    2. Probabilistic packet loss that increases with distance
    3. Configurable transmission power and minimum signal thresholds

    Optimized for real-time applications using spatial indexing (KD-Tree) to efficiently
    compute agent proximity relationships.
