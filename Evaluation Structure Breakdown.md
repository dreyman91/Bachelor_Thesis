Step 1: Validate Failure_API Functionality
* Wrap a PettingZoo environment (e.g., simple_spread) with your Failure_API.
* Run basic interactions:
   * Agents take random or scripted actions.
   * Check if observation masking is applied correctly.
* Visualize observation spaces before and after masking to ensure correctness.
Step 2: Verify API-Environment Compatibility
* Ensure the environment can:
   * Step through episodes without errors.
   * Maintain correct agent cycling.
* Confirm Failure_API integrates cleanly with:
   * PettingZoo wrappers
   * RL algorithm interface (action/observation flow remains valid).
Step 3: Pilot Performance Measurement
* Run a small batch of test episodes (e.g., 10 episodes, 10 agents).
* Measure:
   * Per-step execution time (Failure_API vs baseline).
   * Basic reward values (with failures active).
* Use this data to:
   * Validate initial API performance.
   * Estimate effect sizes for statistical power analysis.
Step 4: Statistical Power Analysis (Sample Size Planning)
* Based on pilot data:
   * Estimate effect sizes (reward drop %, overhead %).
   * Calculate required sample size per scenario using power analysis tools (target power 80%, Œ± = 0.05).
* Decide on the number of episodes per experiment condition.
Step 5: Define Experiment Scenarios For each of the following scenarios, plan your runs:
* Baseline (no failures)
* Progressive Failure Rates (25%, 50%, 75%)
* Distance-Based Failures (threshold-defined)
* Markovian Failures (transition-based)
* Combined Models (Distance + Delay)
* Topology Change Events (failures introduced mid-episode)
Step 6: Execute Main Experiments
* For each scenario:
   * Run agent training (e.g., MADDPG, QMIX) with Failure_API active.
   * Collect metrics:
      * Episode rewards
      * Task completion time
      * Per-step execution time
      * Masking accuracy logs
      * Communication state logs
* Save data in structured files for analysis (e.g., CSV, JSON).
Step 7: Scalability Testing
* Repeat selected scenarios with increased agent counts:
   * 20 agents, then 50 agents.
* Measure:
   * Execution time scaling.
   * Reward and task performance impact.
Step 8: Adaptability & Ablation Tests
* Run episodes where:
   * Communication topology changes dynamically mid-episode.
   * Specific failure models are disabled (e.g., Distance off, Delay off) to assess their individual effects.
Step 9: Data Analysis & Visualization
* Analyze collected data:
   * Compute averages, variances.
   * Perform statistical tests (t-tests, ANOVA, Chi-square, KL-divergence).
* Generate:
   * Learning curves.
   * Overhead comparison graphs.
   * Task completion time charts.
   * Communication matrix snapshots.
   * Heatmaps and behavior visualizations.
Step 10: Hypothesis Results & Argumentation
* For each hypothesis (H1‚ÄìH5):
   * Report results.
   * Accept or reject based on data and statistical tests.
   * Discuss implications for MARL applications.
