          4. Negotiate ( Sell only for 10 % discount)


Negotiate:- if demand is high, no discount; + reward - Vendors
            if demand is low, apply discount; / reward - Vendors
            if sales are low, apply discount; 0 reward - Vendors
            low budget and no discount  -reward - Customers
            low budget and discount; 0 reward - Customers
            normal budget and discount; + reward - Customers

Walk Away:- if price is too high, customer walks -
            the logic is that, if the current price of a vendor
             is 20% higher than the last price, customer walks
             away, Admin takes note and fines Vendor for price gouging.

           - if price is normal but customer budget is low,
           customer walks and gets a minus reward  and vendor a plus reward-.

Browse Products :- Customer browses through product. No reward

Adjust Prices:- Customer adjust prices based on stock inventory and demand,
                 also based on competitor prices.
                 if competitor price is high; reduce price by 20%; +R
                 if low, maintain original price: 0 reward
                 if stock is low and demand is high, increase price +R
